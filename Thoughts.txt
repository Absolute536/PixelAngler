Let's organise our thoughts here.

Future reference for implementing other functionalities
- CanvasModulate Node for day/night cycle
- Object pooling for the fishing line or other objects (maybe not the fishing line cuz it's only one)

State Management
- So state machine has a collection of states and transitions between each of them
- And the logic for the behaviours in each state should be contained within the implemented State scripts

IDLE -- directional movement --> WALKING
IDLE -- left mouse --> ITEM_ACTION
WALKING -- left mouse --> IDLE (then immediately IDLE detects the left mouse and transitions to ITEM_ACTION)

Walking State
- Directional movement
- If no movement, transitions to Idle
- If mouse click, transitions to Idle, then to ItemAction (or straight away to Item Action)?
