Let's organise our thoughts here.

Future reference for implementing other functionalities
- CanvasModulate Node for day/night cycle
- Object pooling for the fishing line or other objects (maybe not the fishing line cuz it's only one)

State Management
- So state machine has a collection of states and transitions between each of them
- And the logic for the behaviours in each state should be contained within the implemented State scripts

IDLE -- directional movement --> WALKING
IDLE -- left mouse --> ITEM_ACTION
WALKING -- left mouse --> IDLE (then immediately IDLE detects the left mouse and transitions to ITEM_ACTION)

Walking State
- Directional movement
- If no movement, transitions to Idle
- If mouse click, transitions to Idle, then to ItemAction (or straight away to Item Action)?
- (07/10) Mouse click, transitions to Idle, then immediately to Action (renamed) if click is held down

Action State
- ok, let's clear things up here.
- entering action state, check which item is selected
- then invoke the selected item's action???
  -> instantiate the scene/node?
  -> add to player
  -> OH, OK. because it's PLAYER'S state, so it must be tied to player
  -> like player is the "target"
  -> I think we can create an action manager to hold the player's reference and make it a child of the player.
  -> then the manager shall manage the actions
  -> ok, let's test it out.

Cast Marker
- 2 options -> instantiate scene when needed or attach it to player from the very beginning
- operations
- start from player's position + 2 tile to whatever direction the player is facing
- if LMB is held, move the marker's position by increments of 1 tile every t (seconds), up to a max
- upon release, the marker either
  -> reset position to the initial one and hide itself
  -> queue free it
- there is also the need of an indicator as well for the marker
- UPDATE: ok, the cast marker works now, and it's pretty clean, with the ActionManager
- NEXT: implement location detection of the marker when the mouse button is released
- on release: get position, get location (Tiletype), then the position will be the end point for bobber (start point - player origin + 32 or 16?)
- to account for the player's height

Extending from cast marker, we continue to the casting of the bobber and line itself
- upon LMB release of the marker, the final position of the marker is recorded
- depending on the facing direction, the bobber either
  -> move in the opposite direction then to the specified position (vertical)
  -> move in a parabolic curve according to the projectile motion (horizontal)
- the fishing line should also be attached to the bobber as it moves according to:
  -> quadratic beizer curve (complicated)
  -> just a simple parabolic curve?
  -> the built in setting for LineJointMode (idk if this works)

  Autoload
  - the singleton pattern
  - the autoload objects (nodes) will be loaded to the scene tree [always]
  - so we can either like
  - signal bus [reddit idea] => have the subscriber subscribe to the relevant delegates
  - OR master scene => contain wrapper methods for the necessary function within the nodes in scene
  - OR just make World a autoload node

Autoload Continuation
- OK. Let's do it this way.
- GlobalManager -> contain reference of World and provide wrapper methods for other classes to access the methods in World
- SignalBus -> contain a series of events/delegates for when we need one to many notification to the subscribers
