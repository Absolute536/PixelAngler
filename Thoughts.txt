Let's organise our thoughts here.

Future reference for implementing other functionalities
- CanvasModulate Node for day/night cycle
- Object pooling for the fishing line or other objects (maybe not the fishing line cuz it's only one)

State Management
- So state machine has a collection of states and transitions between each of them
- And the logic for the behaviours in each state should be contained within the implemented State scripts

IDLE -- directional movement --> WALKING
IDLE -- left mouse --> ITEM_ACTION
WALKING -- left mouse --> IDLE (then immediately IDLE detects the left mouse and transitions to ITEM_ACTION)

Walking State
- Directional movement
- If no movement, transitions to Idle
- If mouse click, transitions to Idle, then to ItemAction (or straight away to Item Action)?
- (07/10) Mouse click, transitions to Idle, then immediately to Action (renamed) if click is held down

Action State
- ok, let's clear things up here.
- entering action state, check which item is selected
- then invoke the selected item's action???
  -> instantiate the scene/node?
  -> add to player
  -> OH, OK. because it's PLAYER'S state, so it must be tied to player
  -> like player is the "target"
  -> I think we can create an action manager to hold the player's reference and make it a child of the player.
  -> then the manager shall manage the actions
  -> ok, let's test it out.
